RELEASE NOTE HIGHLIGHTS FOR FIRMWARE VENDORS
============================================

v0.18.12:

* Due to the simet_register-ma.sh locking changes, the way the file
  defined by AGENT_TOKEN_LOCK has to be handled changed:

    * It must be truncated to size zero on simet-ma package updates

    * It must be removed on reboot/poweroff: this is usually a
      side-effect of a proper platform that uses tmpfs for /run,
      /var/run, /var/lock and other ephemeral folders.

* The reference cronjobs and post-install scripts in debian/ went
  through important changes: platforms that used those as guidelines
  must carefully check the changes, and incorporate them.

  The daily and weekly cron job scripts now have a defensive five-minute
  random start spread, as a defense against group-sync.

  Note: the OpenWRT reference packaging does not have daily or weekly
  cronjobs, and did not trigger a group-sync.

* The measurement engine had important changes re. timeouts, which come
  into play during server overload spikes.  Error handling for API
  requests and some log messages have been changed as well.

* This release fixes important locking issues in simet_register-ma.sh.

  On simet-ma before v0.18.12, it is possible for concurrent runs of
  simet_register-ma.sh to corrupt the local registration database.

  Any eventual registration inconsistency will be auto-healed by a
  non-concurrent sucessful run of simet_register-ma.sh.

  The auto-healing is complete for embedded devices, which can recover
  their past identity through the virtual label.  Non-embedded devices
  might receive a brand new registration that will not be associated to
  any entitiy (schools, healtcare unit, ISP, or SIMET portal user).

* Ratelimiting of periodic and event-driven invocations of SIMET-MA
  components was revised and fixed.

  Periodic invocations (e.g. cronjobs, periodic timers), and system-hook
  invocations (e.g. WAN connected events, boot events) *must* use either
  the --boot or --daily CLI options of the Measurement Engine scripts.

  E.g.: simet_register-ma.sh --boot.

  When a script supports both --daily and --boot, --daily allows for
  longer timeouts, so it has increased chance of success.  --boot is
  used when you cannot have the script waiting for minutes, and would
  rather it fail.

  The platform must ensure simet_register-ma.sh calls done from
  boot/startup scripts, and system hook scripts (such as when the
  network becomes available) uses either the --boot or --daily options.

  The platform should have simet_register-ma.sh calls scheduled to
  periodically run (every 24h) at a **device-specific** time (note: not
  device-model specific.  The goal here is for it to run at a time that
  could be anywhere in the day, but which will be choosen by each
  specific device so that there is no group behavior).  THIS
  simet_register-ma.sh call MUST NOT use the --boot or --daily options.

  All other periodic and system-hook invocations of simet_register-ma
  must use either the --boot, or the --daily option.

* Periodic calls of scripts of the SIMET measurement engine must not
  group-sync

  Please add an extra layer of defense against group-sync in periodic
  jobs: add an extra random wait of up to five or ten minutes (with a
  granularity of one second) at the start of the periodic jobs, which
  will spread any possible group-sync behavior if the PRNGs are not
  themselves group-sync'd.

  BEWARE BAD PRNG SEEDING: when it is time-based, it *can* cause group
  sync.  Always use device-specific information (e.g. the last 24 bits
  of its MAC address) as part of the seed for the PRNG.

  Note that the LMAP schedules used internally by the SIMET measurement
  engine do add random jitter to the start time of measumenent runs.
