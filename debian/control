Description: NIC.br SIMET Measurement Agent
 This is the Measurement Agent for the SIMET system from NIC.br.  It
 performs several measurements of the Internet connectivity against
 SIMET measurement peers hosted at the IX.br Internet Exchanges as well
 as in NIC.br datacenters, and reports the measurement results to the
 SIMET central servers.
 .
 The user can access the measurement results through a web interface.
 The ISPs can access anonymized measurements done on their networks
 through a separate interface.
 .
 The collected data is used in an aggregated, anonymized format by
 CETIC.br to produce statistics on Internet connectivity [in Brazil],
 and also to generate reports of any relevant issues affecting a large
 number of Brazillian users to CGI.br - Brazil's Internet Steering
 Committee.
